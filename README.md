****

## Course by deeplearning.ai & Amazon Web Services
## Platform: Coursera
## Course objectives
- foundational concepts for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- automated machine learning (AutoML)
- text classification algorithms
- learn how to analyze datasets for statistical bias, transform the dataset into features, and select the most important features to train multi-class text classifier with Amazon SageMaker Clarify and Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler
- perform automate machine learning (AutoML) to automatically train, tune, and deploy the best text-classification algorithm for the given dataset using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot
- work with Amazon SageMaker BlazingText.

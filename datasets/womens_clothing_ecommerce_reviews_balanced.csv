-1,Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.,Blouses
-1,Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,Blouses
-1,An absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.,Blouses
-1,I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.,Blouses
-1,Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.,Blouses
-1,"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",Blouses
-1,This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately,Blouses
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.,Blouses
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.,Blouses
0,These are the cutest prints  but the cute simply doesn't work for me. this is longer than the conversationalist shirt  which is an improvement as far as i'm concerned. nevertheless  both my appropriate size  which i still felt was too short  and the size up  which hit at a flattering spot  were twice as wide as as my midsection. so while the arms and shoulders seem true to size  the shirt runs very wide.,Blouses
0,Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!,Blouses
0,I had reservations about this top based on other reviews  but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin  but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.,Blouses
0,I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured  but because i have a larger chest  the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer  which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.,Blouses
0,I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length  slits  tie  stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas  it isn't meant to be...,Blouses
0,This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.,Blouses
0,Fits well through the shoulders and arms  but there is zero waist  and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute  but have to return because of that.,Blouses
0,"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4""  120 lbs and tried a size s.",Blouses
0,I really liked the top once i saw it  but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine  but it is a nice top.,Blouses
1,I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it  and great for going out with skirt  pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering  light weight  and comfortable.,Blouses
1,Very old color and item. a little full  but comfortable.,Blouses
1,What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me  tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so  i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.,Blouses
1,This top is a lot more striking in person. on  it's quite stunning. it is a tad short but that's part of the aesthetic and i don't find it unflattering. however  the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate  but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath,Blouses
1,Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side  the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice  simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long.,Blouses
1,Super comfortable..great layering piece or by itself...got lots of compliments at work.,Blouses
1,This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.,Blouses
1,"I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on  the perfect length  beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb and the s was for me.",Blouses
1,I love this top  it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small  it is true to size. very classy!!,Blouses
-1,Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.,Dresses
-1,I thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that  the dress is as it appears.,Dresses
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress  but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses. it runs small throughout  and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed  but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8 10 and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress  w",Dresses
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!,Dresses
-1,I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be,Dresses
-1,This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.,Dresses
-1,The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,Dresses
-1,I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper  looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit  lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a,Dresses
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors  and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made  but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this  i would say size down two sizes.",Dresses
0,I wanted to love this dress. i pre-ordered it and waiting 2 weeks for it arrive. when it arrived the dress was much more pleated than i thought. i'm not sure if i misunderstood the images  but i did not know the dress was going to being pleated all over  i just thought that the fabric had a texture. the print is adorable but the shape of the dress was not flattering on me. i am pretty straight down with somewhat wide hips  but the fabric of the dress made me look larger than i am. i think this w,Dresses
0,I love this dress but when i put it on i was aghast! the chest was tight and the body was voluminous!! added the pounds which no wants! best left to the waify girls.,Dresses
0,This is a pretty dress  but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.,Dresses
0,I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!,Dresses
0,I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per,Dresses
0,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.,Dresses
0,I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.,Dresses
0,"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!",Dresses
0,"This dress does run a tad small. for me it was small across the chest and i did have to shimmy into it. i am 5'6""  110 and got size s. if i had gotten the m it would have looked a tad frumpy (on me). pretty  but wasn't happy with the fit aside from that the ""line""separating the top from the bottom was rather high for me and it seems that it was not really intended to be an ""umpire"" waist. i tried a belt with it and at my natural waist left the line uncovered several inches up toward my chest. i",Dresses
1,The photo of this dress does not do it justice. this dress is absolutely gorgeous. the construction is very high quality. i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty. total non-issue with this dress. the petite fit is also spot on. it is slightly large in the back bodice for me  but i always have that problem. it's an easy tailoring fix.  i think i'm in love with byron lars <3,Dresses
1,I love this dress. i've received compliments from everyone. it's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and  it's beautiful!,Dresses
1,I love the colors on this dress  very nice on a pale skin. i ahd this in my wish list for so long  and it finally went on sale. i ordered it and was very pleased. only drawback is the collar was a little irritating (but i am ok with it). it fits like a glove (o)  i didn't think it would as there are no petites  but that worked for me  the lace pattern is classy. and the hem is totally fun. great purchase (maybe petite would not have bothered my neck).  115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist,Dresses
1,Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable  the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece,Dresses

1,I ordered this online with out trying it on the store. it does hang a teeny bit loser than in the photo of the model but in my opinion doesn't look bad. plus  i'm not a model...;) what i did was put a thick belt on and it just brought the dress to a new level. love it with a belt. i am an art teacher and it was perfect for work and then going out after with friends.

-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.,Fine gauge
-1,"The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",Fine gauge

-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.,Fine gauge
-1,I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.,Fine gauge
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,Fine gauge
-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.,Fine gauge
0,"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of",Fine gauge
0,I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!,Fine gauge
0,First of all i love cashmere so by default i love this sweater shawl. the photos are a bit odd because you can wear it two different ways. if you wear it so it's long in front then the back comes up a bit higher and vice versa. my only big complaint is that i've worn it twice and there's already a large hole in the arm seam. poor construction which is disappointing. hopefully mine was a one-off. i'd recommend it but definitely wait for a sale.,Fine gauge

0,Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d,Fine gauge

0,This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable  with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale,Fine gauge

1,This is an awesome pointelle sweater. i love angel of the north sweaters. i bought the small (34b) and it fit tts. the pleats in the back hang without pulling. it also flatters the figure with it's shaping. it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red. just love it!,Fine gauge
1,I passed this over on first sight because it looked like it might be on the short side in length. after seeing a few other photos and reading the reviews  i opted to give it a go. the store did not have my usual xs or even a size small  so i tried on the medium. it was too wide as expected  but the shoulders are adjustable so i fiddled with it a bit and decided it was really cute. there were no more xs available to order so i asked if the store could order the small. it arrived and is absolutely,Fine gauge

1,I love this tank  it is casual and comfortable  but has the little scarf attached to it  so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular  and would need petite  it was a bit long on me  but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral  good piece to add to a transition wardrobe.

1,I tried on the white top at the store. the quality was very good and i loved the overall concept of the design. the dark stripes on the back are slightly raised  giving it a nice texture. the fabric was soft and comfortable. however  the shape just didn't drape as well on me as i had hoped  so ultimately i didn't buy it. perhaps a petite length would have fit me better.,Fine gauge

-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates

0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates

0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates

1,This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.,Intimates
1,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,Intimates
1,Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing  i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.,Intimates

1,I really love this camisole  but it's shorter than i expected.,Intimates
1,Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.,Intimates
1,I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.,Intimates
1,The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality  then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit  i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!,Intimates
-1,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",Jackets
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.,Jackets
-1,I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.,Jackets
-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,Jackets
-1,"When i saw this jacket in store  i fell in love with it. the colors with the quilting and gold studs are gorgeous. i am 5'3"" 130# 36dd with petite frame. i tried a m on in store and the sleeves were super long and wide. the s was too small across chest and hung open oddly. the jacket is a nice heavy weight and great quality. i ordered a petite m and it was no better. i literally looked like a big marshmallow...a linebacker! the sleeves were so unflattering where it looked like i was wearing pvc",Jackets
-1,This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.,Jackets

-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref,Jackets
0,Looks so cute in the picture  but just didn't really look that flattering on - plus the sleeves were too tight and too long for my short arms so going back....,Jackets
0,You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!,Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.,Jackets
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.,Jackets
0,The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it  then it might be for you  but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.,Jackets
0,If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.,Jackets
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted,Jackets
0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.,Jackets
1,This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.,Jackets
1,"This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an ""easy"" look. i've already worn this with a dress  and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6""  138 lbs and took a medium.",Jackets
1,I ordered this online  but i own the vest and i love it  so i took a chance. this is a super comfy  great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color  i ordered the green  is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that  you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended,Jackets
1,The only thing i didn't like about this is i wish it was a little bit shorter  but otherwise great! throw it on with pants and add a bit of color and spring/summer'ness to your outfit!,Jackets
1,"Been searching for a denim ""trucker"" jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock  purchased it online without thinking twice. typically  due to my small upper frame  i'm 5'4  130lbs  34 a for referance  i'm between a size small and an xs. bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived.   i love the fit  slightly cropped in the back and i also like how it""s lined inside. great quality and perfect for fall!",Jackets
1,Ordered this in my typical size  xs  and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis  but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus  there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral  brown that should go with almost anything.,Jackets
1,Perfect for summer nights. makes any outfit that much special!,Jackets
1,I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!,Jackets
1,This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket  i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium  but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now  but might reorder in a small another time.,Jackets
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.,Jeans
-1,"Woah  these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom's closet. the combination of the light wash  the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5'3"" / 140 curvy. no  no  no!",Jeans
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.,Jeans
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.,Jeans
-1,Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,Jeans
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.,Jeans
-1,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.,Jeans
-1,"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",Jeans
-1,"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however  on me  they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus  back they went. for reference  i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6.",Jeans
0,They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.,Jeans
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,Jeans

0,I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r,Jeans
0,"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these  but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin  tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short.     i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on  which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them  i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.    better for",Jeans
0,"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand.",Jeans
0,"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!",Jeans
0,I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,Jeans

1,Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didn't disappoint. ridiculously comfortable! i think they run a tad big  but maybe not enough to size down. just enough to where i'll need to wash them more often  maybe.,Jeans
1,"I love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly  too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am 5'4"" and a size 2  and the 26 fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build  rather than curvy.",Jeans
1,I am 5'9 and i wear my usual 27 like i always do in pilcro. i am so sad that they are too short. they are 32.5 inches long and it's just too short for my legs even with flats. the fit is great and they run true to size but they are too short for tall girls. i usually buy the wide leg linen pants and those are long enough. these needed to be about an inch longer. i do recommend them if you're a bit shorter :),Jeans
1,These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!,Jeans
1,I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.,Jeans
1,These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy  stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?  116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off  the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!,Jeans
1,Those are very cute and lavender color is very beautiful in person  however i do not like the cut. waist goes about inch higher than usual pilcro  which for summer heat is something i do not find neither practical nor pretty and unfortunately i have to send them back : (. also  this year pilcro runs little bit tighter in waist than usual  so you might consider ordering one size up if you are between sizes.,Jeans
1,Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5  size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe.,Jeans

-1,The turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.,Knits
-1,I ordered the black and white pattern  which was ok. i got a small  but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.,Knits
-1,Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.,Knits
-1,This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.,Knits
-1,First  it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.,Knits
-1,When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.,Knits
-1,I bought this shirt in a l  since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone  unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy  but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.,Knits

0,I ordered the green and lilac. the pink color was not offered when i placed my order so that was not an option. i found that it ran true to size  but was a loose fit. the lilac color had white streaks from the the-dyed effect  but it looked like someone had spilled paint on the front in one area so i did not even try that one on. for now  i am keeping the green one  but it is a deeper green than pictured and also a looser fit than on the model. i do like that it is 100 percent cotton and very so,Knits

-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors  but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out  but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.,Layering
1,I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium. i probably could have gone with a small  but given that i am a 34d on top (and @ a size 2 on the bottom & @ 120lbs)  the medium fits me just fine. it is super soft  and you can wear it with just about anything. keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are. however  i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt (so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time,Layering

1,I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit  but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!,Layering

1,Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself  but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!,Layering

1,I bought this in the plum & love the color. i got this in xs which is my usual size & it's a little bit baggy but i think this is the style of the sweater. the front on me is not as long as pictured but just covers the top of my pants. my daughter liked it so much she bought the exact same one.,Sweaters
1,I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color  which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.,Sweaters

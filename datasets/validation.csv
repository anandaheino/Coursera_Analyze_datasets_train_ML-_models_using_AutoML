__label__1 "i found this to be true to size ( m fit me well - 5 ' 7 140 lb usually a size m for tops ) . it does have a straight fit and it hits at the waist . i would n't call it cropped but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer . it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath and you can pull the shirt 's cuffs over the sweatshirt . the sleeves were a great length ."
__label__0 "runs shorter than i expected . i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size ."
__label__0 "runs a little small in the shoulders/bust"
__label__-1 "the color is darker than shown ( i ordered the denim looking one ) . the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color . it must be great for the tall skinny model but if your 5 ' 4 '' and pear shaped like me it 's a no go ! took it back to my local store ."
__label__0 "i saw this online and loved it . plus after reading the reviews i thought why not . but if you have a big chest beware . i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium . the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small . had to return ."
__label__0 "bought in white . it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear . the white is pretty sheer . will return ."
__label__-1 "i 'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone . this looks cute on the model but when i received it it 's actually very flowing . i wanted more of a straight cut . does n't work very well on my body . i 'm 5 ' 3 123 lbs . 34-d. it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__0 "i went on a wild goose chase for these jeans as they were sold out all around the country . i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest ! they are my favorite pair of jeans they fit very well . however for the price they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears . i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly . expensive jeans should not sag . i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose even after 20 wears"
__label__-1 "this coat is awful just awful . i bought it based on the reviews my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress . it looked awful . i really really liked the softness and that it was n't like another puffer coat it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear but the look style and design make it very unflattering . it looked so bad that i took it off right away . so disappointing !"
__label__-1 "i splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed . i 'm a 36d and the l was so tight i could n't get it over my chest . also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped . and the fabric is shiny the picture makes it look like it 's matte . if it did fit like the model i would 've loved it . the print is beautiful though . bummer"

__label__-1 "fabric is not as rich as shown in photo . dress much shorter than shown in photo . shoulder area is tight and really does n't blend with the material below . this is n't going to work on very many people - pear shape ... just not what i 've come to expect from retailer ."
__label__-1 "so this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer . this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute . it looked a million times cuter in the photos ."

__label__-1 "i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed . loved the skirt part of it . but the top which i guess i did n't see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides . would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool ."
__label__1 "i have so many compliments on this blouse . i love the style and design . i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 58 tall . i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it wo n't look right in the back kinda hang out . otherwise really nice quality blouse . i would definitely buy another just to have a back up ."

__label__-1 "a beautiful sweater and very flattering on . the stock photos do not do it justice . but i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i could n't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute ."
__label__0 "i was so in love with these when i saw them online . they arrived today and while the fit was great i was disappointed . the colors are definitely more drab in person than what 's pictured in the photo . the material is very thick . it 's soft and they 'd be warm in cold weather i 'm sure . i liked them but they were underwhelming . if they were less expensive i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they 'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work but sadly back they go ."
__label__0 "the high neck and square-ness did not work for me .. but might for someone else ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress for a holiday party and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo . i still liked it but when i went to try it on it was just not working . i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted . i would recommend sizing up but be aware that the top straps ( shoulder to breast ) are too loose to begin with so they may sag . overall i would n't recommend this dress for the curren"
__label__0 "i have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer and this is not it . like others it 's just so thin and sheer . i live in the south . i do n't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything . this is fine to layer in cooler temps but now in our horrible summers where that 's the last thing i wish to do . - the only plus i can tell you is it 's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin . however"
__label__1 "absolutely in love with this dress ! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout . i 'm a 34b 27 waist and 36 hip and 5 ' 3 and went with the xsp . very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price ."
__label__1 "this top was very pretty when i got it but i was hoping it would be a bit longer . the v neck design was nice and the fabric very soft . i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine ."
__label__1 "tis is a soft soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute . it 's a great top to use put on and go . i 'm looking forward to wearing it often !"
__label__1 "the tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look . it fits well to the body even better than pictured . very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring ."
__label__1 "this dress is very comfortable not itchy at all and looks great . runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it 's still a worthwhile buy !"
__label__1 "this top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers . so many nice details and a great fit !"
__label__-1 "on my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette . maybe will work for someone who likes pastels . overall style was also disappointing- just hung . this went back ."
__label__-1 "this blouse is a disappointment ! it runs so large it looks ridiculous . the cute is super wide and flared . they must have it pinned on the model . it is not flattering at all . i really thought this could be cute . not worth the money either ! it 's expensive and ill-fitting . for reference i am 5 ' 3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4 ."
__label__1 "amazingly soft thin and super warm ! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny !"
__label__-1 "i wish this fit me better . i love the inside fur . it is extremely soft but it does n't look flattering at all . it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted . it wanted it fit over my butt ( or cover half ) and it sits a little below my waist . unfortunately i am taking it back . great idea though ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top but could n't . i am curvy ( 36/27/39 ; 32dd ) and this accentuated my hips ( which is not needed ) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy . i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape ; pleating on front would help chest seem larger . i did love the color and construction lace details 3/4 sleeves ."
__label__1 "this skirt is really beautiful and well made . the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned . it fits mostly true to size -- i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips . i just love this skirt ."
__label__0 "not up to retailer standards ! fabric quite thin ( you could see nude-color bra through the white one ) and thin fabric wide bottom hung sloppy ; no way i would feel well dressed in this top . i returned it ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! although it is a tad big i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big . however i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it 's too big .... hope that makes sense ! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair but the yellow was so pretty too !"
__label__1 "this blazer is really well made it has a nice weight and stretch to it . i think it might run a bit on the large size i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect . it 's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look . i do n't think the picture here does it justice . it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe . i love it !"

__label__1 "soft knit perfectly finished comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers ' mom . it just looks too 'empty-nester ' for my style ( and i wo n't be until 2035 ! ) this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer which i 'm not . i 'm also messy so it 's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free . i 'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments . just had to pass on this for personal style reasons ."
__label__0 "i loved the fit color and style but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap . i was worried that it would tear easily . this is getting returned ."

__label__0 "i was really excited to receive this caftan but it looked very strange on my body . i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me . there 's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy . the quality is really great but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured ."

__label__-1 "ref : 5 ' 4 125 # 27/4 32g . i do n't think this is for us shorter women . this hits you right where you do n't want a vertical line to hit . it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are . the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i could n't even dream of making this work . i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me ! glad i tried in-store and did n't online order ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner . i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height . i was for sure it would be too short in any other size . when i put it on i was drowning in it ! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal . has the potential to be super cute and flattering yet the timing and sizing did n't work out . definitely give this one a try !"

__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work but the previous reviews were exactly correct the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit . the bottom has lots of fabric which would n't be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit then the bottom becomes overwhelming . i am 5 ' 5 and 115 so i have a slim build and could n't get the bodice to zip in a small . the medium would have needed altering which would n't have fixed the extra fabric on th"
__label__-1 "hahaha .. this dress is hilarious ! it looks nothing like the image ! i am usually a 0/xs and 4 was the smallest size available so i ordered it . when i opened it it felt like 10 lbs of fabric . i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress . once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing . the rest of the dress is huge . i do n't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone ."
__label__1 "just bought this at the store . just to be safe i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size . that was a good idea . ( i am a 38b 5 ' 9 and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts . ) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest . when directly compared to the medium it seems the major difference is the length -- the large was > 1 longer than the medium . i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok ."
__label__0 "i found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected . not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i 'll be returning it . also runs a bit large . would have returned it for an xs if i loved it ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this shirt ! i got it in both the black and moss ( which is a beautiful color ) . however the ruffle was just too big . i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown . it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves but on me it was not flattering at all ."
__label__0 "the fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it . my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm so if you are n't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm it will show ... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders"

__label__1 "i got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments . it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night . it is a little long and falls below the knee but otherwise the dress fits and feels great . the fabric has a nice weight so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide ."

__label__-1 "the top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige . well i 'm blonde with fair skin so i 'm not sure this is going to work . it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual . i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts"

__label__-1 "nice design but very wrinkly fabric that does n't fall well . also as has happened to me before retailer sent me a dress clearly worn/used and returned by someone else with hair all over it . you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out ."
__label__0 "i loved the idea of this dress but i find that it is n't very flattering . i think the arm holes are actually very interesting but i 'm 5 ' 5 and 135lbs and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all . maybe it would look better on a different body type . the material is soft but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair ."

__label__1 "this is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own . i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway . the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute . i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style ."

__label__-1 "such a cute pattern and i loved the fold-over design but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage ! i should 've looked more closely at the photo - it 's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage . a couple more inches of fabric would 've really helped . i 'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with . i could maybe wear them around my husband but definitely not my dad ! i felt like if i bent"

__label__1 "i love the color which is eye popping without being gaudy . i am 142lbs 5 ' 4 and got size 4. it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin . the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph . it does have wide arm holes so a bra even a strapless one could be tricky although it was n't a gaping hole for me . i think i could wear it over a green bikini-like halter bra and take care of the arm issue ."

__label__0 "i love the look and feel of this easy dress . i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip however i was in between sizes . the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big . this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type especially in a madras plaid ."

__label__-1 "unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - do n't even think about getting this dress ! it 's literally a heavy sack . it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back . the material is nice but it 's an awful shape !"
__label__1 "i got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it . it 's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together . i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8 my normal size . it 's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric . in the 8 it 's just right for the style ."
__label__-1 "after reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it i loved the fabric and color however it was so ill-fitting . it 's like the designer did n't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top -- too wide . i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly . it is too wide and not long enough . both are going back !"

__label__0 "i like this top . it went well with my olive pant . i tried in l and xl . l was a tad fitted around my tummy . xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low . i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just did n't work . i am busty perhaps it may work better for a slender frame . i recommend this top because it is pretty but the fit is selective so its best to try out a couple of sizes first ."
__label__0 "i was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog . i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs . it was huge . reminded me of a maternity top . it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model . the material was nice thin but not see through . the macrame detailing seemed well made . i 'd recommend this if you 're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down ."

__label__1 "this dress is adorable . it 's very comfortable and so flattering . the only thing is i ca n't understand why it is priced so high . it 's a great dress but i 'm just not convinced it 's the worth the price tag . i 'm going to watch for it to go on sale . fingers crossed !"
__label__1 "i got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body . the front ruffle is n't overpowering although i do n't love the ruffles on the sleeves . i think it 's just a little too much but they are n't visible under a sweater or jacket . the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy . the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through . it 's a good shirt ."

__label__1 "this dress is beautiful . it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it . i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button . it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season ."

__label__-1 "even on sale sale ... this tank is not worth the money . the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy ( think old man white tanks that come in a pack ) completely see through and lack of shape .. i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality !"

__label__1 "i love this top . of course i love most things that are denim or look like denim . this is a fun twist on a denim shirt the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching . i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it ! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional ."
__label__0 "these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable . unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price . i do n't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i 'm not so sure . i guess if you do n't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what 's the point of buying them ?"
__label__1 "these short are the best ! the denim is incredibly soft . they go perfect with both casual and nice tops . i would wear them out everyday if i could ."
__label__1 "very cute on fits well . versatile top i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall ."

__label__0 "i love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height ( 5 ' 4 ) . i 'm thinking about having it altered not sure if i will do that or return it . i love the colors and the back cut out it may be a better length for taller individuals ."
__label__0 "i bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40 % off clearance . i 'm just under 5 ' 4 curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses . i ordered a mr because being sale items only regular sizing was available . a sp would have been much better ! the dress hit about 3 below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly . a snugger fit would have been sexier . the rose was darker than pictured & pretty but eh on me . however the sapphire was gorgeous . i 'm sad about returning it ."

__label__-1 "i am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra . it 's soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape . i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support . if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it . however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it . it 's comfortable so that 's a redeeming quality . i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though !"

__label__0 "this is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i could n't for a few reasons i thought i 'd share : the color is bright orange . it is not softer like peach in the picture . it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear . i thought 'd be more swingy but it was more structured . very pretty and good quality tho ."
__label__1 "it is a beautiful dress light and delicate . i got my usual xsmall ( 5 ' 4 34c 134 lbs ) . it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted . it worked for me but i can see this being an issue . it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip . it is worth it . very cute dress ."

__label__-1 "it is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion . i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly ... this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women 's apparel sizing . i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small"
__label__0 "this runs small i got the size 3 which fits like a medium not a large . its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy . i loved the elbow length sleeves . i have a large 34g bust and although this fit it came to the top of my waist and i 'm short-waisted . it 's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length ."

__label__0 "this jacket runs very large . i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium . i have long arms and the sleeves were way past my hands . i love the jacket but it 's just too sloppy ."
__label__1 "girls this dress is gorgeous . but if you are an a/b cup there is just too much fabric in the bust . the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number . alas i had to send it back and was very sad to do so ."
__label__-1 "this had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me . it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks nothing like the photo . the sequins are dull no sheen at all . the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap shiny plastic . i did n't even try it on because it was so hideous when i pulled it out of the box . not remotely worth the price and would n't buy it on sale for $ 20 either . skip ."
__label__0 "adorable suit super cute print and great quality but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted . i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top . the straps are also very thin and did n't offer too much support ."
__label__0 "let me start this review by saying 75 % of my clothing is from retailer and i love them . my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it 's gorgeous but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other . i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue . sometimes is was extreme sometimes is was n't as noticeable . it was noticeable to me however as i am 6 ' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short . love the sweater as it wa"
__label__-1 "i loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors . however two of them shrunk . i was very disappointed ."
__label__0 "i ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store . i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected . it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner . i would love to see it in a different fabric ! sadly returned it ...."
__label__1 "the fit and design are interesting . in the 00p the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required . the quality is fine . but the color was very blah with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme . that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused . with the lining and material weight it would be more a cold weather item only not an all seasonal dress . generally it was interesting but not a most come home wit"
__label__-1 "so i really loved this dress . i am tall ( 6ft ) and the size 8 was perfect length . i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals . i would say it is true to size . i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack . the back is just gorgeous and unique . here is why i could n't make it mine . the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin . there is literally not much to it and i 'm not sure it wou"
__label__1 "i really like this top ! it 's lightweight great quality and i 've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work ."
__label__-1 "such a pretty fall sweater . nice fit . wore it once out shopping and it snagged : ( had to return sadly ."
__label__1 "i agree with the previous review i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store ( which is 2 hrs from my house ! ) . the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy . the caveat it is quite short . i am 5'10 135 lbs . i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed ."
__label__-1 "then this one is for you ! so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale . based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirt 's ugly secret : a pouch . yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat . the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots . this one"
__label__0 "the fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon . the pattern is pretty and flattering . sadly the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips . if i size up the v-neck might be too wide . i 'm disappointed that i 'll have to return it . it probably would look great on a different body type . i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types ."
__label__1 "love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans . easy to wear and very comfortable"
__label__0 "this sweater is beautiful and well made but i found the cut strange and unflattering . i ordered it in my usual size small and it was too big in the shoulders and arms with a lot of fabric bunching up under my arms . but it just fit me in the chest and would be too tight if i sized down . this might work for you if you are not busty and order a size down from your usual ."
__label__-1 "1. this looks so cute on the model does n't it ? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants but it looks cute . 2. that said keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall . i 'm 5 feet 6 inches tall and this jacket came down to my knees . i 'm not kidding . the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist so more like 7/8 sleeves . 3. i 'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets but this only comes s m or l. the medium is really a size 10 which was too tight across the shoulders and"
__label__0 "i ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt . i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit . i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse ? i 'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it 's"
__label__-1 "i was so bummed by this dress ! i had high hopes when i ordered it but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived . the body of the dress is unlined fleece material -- it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of . i found the fit baggy and unflattering . the shawl portion is only attached at the very top of the shoulders very disappointed . i already returned this ."
__label__-1 "these pants looked worn washed & old looking when i received them ! the quality is super thin cotton as if it 's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart ! the workmanship is terrible . you can see loose stitching all over . the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out . i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online ..."
__label__0 "when these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach . the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft . the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast . the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day . it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly . the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on"
__label__-1 "got this in purple and love it ! ordered red and silver and only received red so far but had to return because it was oddly shaped and did n't fit well like the purple . not sure what happens . maybe miss sized ?"
__label__1 "beautiful washes well in a garment bag on delicate . has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine . i normally go for a large but was definitely a medium in this dress . 32 waist 32f bra only minor complaint is that the pattern ( at least on the red though probably also on the others ) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than"
__label__1 "best beachy summer tunic in the store . can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight . can be worn over jeans shorts a bathing suit take your pick . wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not . it works wither way . asymmetrical cut . great for us long-legged tall people . fabulous buy . only con is that it 's a tad delicate . unfinished hem and loose-knit . will easily snag if you are n't mindful . i recommend hand wash air dry ."
__label__-1 "the dress ran big but is tight at the bust material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off . you ca n't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress ."
